== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin foolproof? =

No. Since the only way to detect what OS/Browser/Tablet/Mobile is being used by the user is through the UserAgent data sent by all browsers/applications any user can change this information and navigate as a different platform. This is done mainly by developers so itÂ´s safe to say that the percentage of users doing this is very low, if any on a live site.
